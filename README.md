# 📝 Hate Speech Detection with NLP

This project focuses on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for detecting **hate speech** in tweets using **text classification** techniques. The goal is to preprocess textual data, tokenize it, and train a machine learning model to identify hate speech, offensive language, and neutral content.

## 📌 Project Overview  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data by removing noise (such as URLs, mentions, emojis, and special characters).  
- **Text Vectorization**: Convert tweets into numerical representations using tokenization and padding.  
- **Model Training**: Train a model using **Deep Learning** techniques to classify the text into different categories (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).  
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model on a test set to measure performance and accuracy.

## 🛠️ Techniques Used  

### 🔹 Data Preprocessing  
- Cleaned the tweet text by removing **URLs, mentions, emojis, digits, and special characters**.  
- Applied **tokenization and stemming** to convert text into word sequences and reduce words to their root forms.  
- Removed **stop words** to eliminate non-informative words and enhance feature extraction.  

### 🔹 Model Architecture  
- **Tokenizer**: Used the Keras Tokenizer to convert text into sequences of integers, ensuring the model can learn the meaning of words.  
- **Padding**: Ensured uniform input length by applying **padding** to sequences.  
- **Deep Learning Model**: Used LSTM/GRU layers (if added in future work) to capture long-range dependencies in tweet data.  
- **Embeddings**: Converted words into **dense vector representations** for better feature extraction.

### 🔹 Model Training & Validation  
- Split the dataset into **training**, **validation**, and **test** sets for effective model evaluation.  
- Used **accuracy metrics** for evaluation to measure the model’s effectiveness at detecting hate speech.

## ⚠️ Issues in Testing  
- **Class Imbalance**: The dataset had an uneven distribution of categories (more neutral/less hate speech).  
- **Data Sparsity**: Some classes (like hate speech) had fewer examples, leading to model bias.  
- **Generalization**: The model showed limited **generalization** ability due to the small size of certain class categories.
